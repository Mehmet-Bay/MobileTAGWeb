  "termsInfo": "1. Introduction\nPlease read all information carefully.\n\n1.1 Mobile-TAG is an application designed to simplify and streamline the collection of information in the event of vehicle incidents. One of the biggest advantages of Mobile-TAG is that it eliminates language barriers.\nMobile-TAG enables drivers to complete reports in their own language instead of the official language of the country where their vehicle is registered. Mobile-TAG-AUTO handles all translations automatically.\n\n2. Advantages of using Mobile-TAG:\n2.1 Independent use – Mobile-TAG is a standalone application that can be used by any driver.\n2.2 Multilingual support – The application supports multiple languages ​​and adapts automatically if the selected language is available, the user can read the questions in their own language but the report is created in the official language of the vehicle.\n2.3 Automated documentation – Automatically creates a read-only PDF report with all necessary information.\n2.4 Quick sharing – The report can be easily sent to other parties and insurance companies via e-mail.\n2.5 Clear structure – Each driver gets his own page in the report, making it clear who reported what.\n2.6 User friendly – ​​The app guides you step by step and ensures that important information is collected.\n\n3. How Mobile-TAG works:\n3.1 Language support – The app handles automatic translations, so the driver receives the report in the vehicle's registration language.\n3.2 Report generation – In the event of an incident, the user fills in the information, and Mobile-TAG creates a PDF report.\n3.3 Secure sharing – The report is read-only and can be sent directly to the parties via email if email addresses are provided.\n\n4. Important recommendations:\n4.1 Follow local laws – In the event of serious accidents with personal injuries or when the vehicle cannot be driven on, emergency services and roadside assistance must be contacted according to local regulations.\n4.2 Safety measures - Ensure that everyone involved is safe and that other road users are warned in a safe way.\n5. User responsibility:\n\n5.1 Truthfulness - You are responsible for providing accurate and truthful information in the report.\n5.2 Document storage – You are responsible for keeping the PDF report secure and protecting it from unauthorized access.\n5.3 Legal Penalties – Providing false information may lead to legal action by affected parties, including insurance companies.\n\n6. Language support:\n6.1 Mobile-TAG supports multiple languages, making it easy for drivers from different countries to use the app. The report can be generated in the official language of the country where the vehicle is registered.\nThe language translations are handled by machine translation.\n6.2 Available languages ​​include but are not limited to –\nArabic, Bulgarian, Bosnian, Czech, German, Danish, French, English, Dutch, Greek, Italian, Irish, Norwegian, Mongolian, Malay, Kazakh, Hindi, Urdu, Persian, Serbian, Slovenian, Slovak, Turkish, Portuguese(Brazil) , Polish, Russian, Finnish, Ukrainian, Luxembourgish, Hungarian, Swedish, Romanian, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Indonesian, Uzbek, Somali, Spanish and Vietnamese.\nThis means that the document can be created in these languages ​​and that they are also available for machine translation and users can report incorrect translations to improve future versions.\n\n7. Data protection and security:\n7.1 Encryption – Personal data is encrypted and stored securely in accordance with data protection regulations.\n7.2 TLS protection – All data sent to the server, for example when drivers are connected in a joint report, is encrypted via TLS.\n7.4 Privacy – All data is stored locally on the device and is only shared when the user chooses to send the report. No data is stored on Mobile-TAG's server, and no third party has access to the communication.\n\n8. Purpose:\n8.1 Mobile-TAG is developed to streamline and simplify claims handling. The app guides the user step by step, eliminates language barriers and generates a professional, read-only report. The report can be used as a basis for contact with insurance companies or other parties involved.\n\n9.

Phone lines may be busy, online services may require logins, and help may not be available during evenings or weekends. This can add to the stress at an already difficult moment.\n\nMobile-TAG is designed to help drivers organize and record incident information directly on their mobile device. Within a few minutes, drivers can summarize what happened in a clear and structured way, allowing them to leave the scene calmly and review or share the information later when needed.\n\nThe app does not replace official reports, insurance systems, or required procedures.
