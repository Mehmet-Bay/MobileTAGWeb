Some features that normally rely on internet access—such as sending the document by email or sharing it with another device—may be limited until a connection becomes available. If no internet connection is available at the scene, the document can be saved locally and shared later when connectivity is restored. Offline use typically means that the incident is documented on a single device and the document is generated in one language. For full multi-language synchronization between drivers, both devices need the app and an active connection. Mobile-TAG is designed to work even in environments with limited connectivity, such as parking areas, underground garages, or rural roads. Offline functionality may be further improved in future updates."

        </div>
        <div>
        <h2>10. What is Mobile-TAG for?</h2>
        <p>Mobile-TAG is a note-taking tool designed for drivers to exchange information
            and document minor traffic incidents in just a few minutes, even when different

        </p>
        </div>
        <div>
        <h2>11. Which language should I use for my documentation?</h2>
        <p>You should enter your information or descriptions in the same language that is selected in the app’s interface.
           This helps ensure that translations remain accurate, clear, and consistent.
           The app prepares the accident template in the selected language while always preserving the original text.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div>
        <h2>12. How can I get the best translation quality?</h2>
            <p>
            When entering information or descriptions, try to write as clearly and grammatically correct as possible.

        </p>
        </div>
        <div>
        <h2>14. How to scan the QR code?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Open the Mobile-TAG app</li>
            <li>Tap <strong>Create document</strong> on the main screen</li>
            <li>Tap the <strong>QR</strong> button</li>
            <li>Scan the QR code placed in the vehicle to load vehicle information to the Mobile-TAG application.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>15. What should I do if I have just had a car accident?</h2>
            <p>
                First, make sure everyone is safe.
                If there are any injuries or the situation is dangerous, contact emergency services immediately.
            </p>
            <p>

                <p>
                    Mobile-TAG can be used by two drivers even if only one device is available.<br>
                    In this case, the incident is documented on a single device and a document is created in one language.<br>
                    The document language is determined by the vehicle registration country selected on the device used.<br>
                    If the other driver is registered in another country, a copy of the document can be shared, but it will not be translated.<br>
                    For full language support and identical documents in each driver’s official vehicle registration language, it is recommended that both drivers use the Mobile-TAG app.<br>
                    The second driver can easily download the app by scanning the download QR code available from the information section on the app’s start screen, which links directly to Google Play or the App Store.<br>

            <h2>18. Can Mobile-TAG be used offline?</h2>
            <p>
            Yes. Mobile-TAG can be used without an internet connection.<br>
            When used offline, the incident can still be documented and a complete report can be created on the device.<br>
            Some features that normally rely on internet access—such as sending the document by email or sharing it with another device—may be limited until a connection becomes available.<br>
            If no internet connection is available at the scene, the document can be saved locally and shared later when connectivity is restored.<br>
            Offline use typically means that the incident is documented on a single device and the document is generated in one language. For full multi-language synchronization between drivers, both devices need the app and an active connection.<br>
            Mobile-TAG is designed to work even in environments with limited connectivity, such as parking areas, underground garages, or rural roads. Offline functionality may be further improved in future updates.

                19. What if we use only one device and the other driver does not understand our language?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Mobile-TAG can also be used in situations where only one device is available and the other driver does not understand the language used on the device.<br><br>
                When selecting the option “The other driver does not have Mobile-TAG”, the app allows the other driver to enter their contact information directly on the same device.<br><br>
                During this step, the language can be temporarily switched to the language preferred by the other driver, so all instructions and input fields are clearly understandable.<br><br>
                Once the other driver has completed their part, Mobile-TAG automatically switches back to the original language selected on the device.<br><br>
                This makes it possible to document the incident clearly even when only one device is used and the drivers do not share a common language.<br><br>

            20. Why tools like Mobile-TAG exist?
            </h2>
            <p>
            Digital tools like Mobile-TAG are designed to support drivers at the moment an minor incident occurs.
            In minor traffic incidents, the immediate need is often to exchange information and document what happened quickly and clearly, while the situation is still fresh. Time pressure, stress, language differences, and unfamiliar surroundings can make this difficult.
            Mobile-TAG focuses on this initial documentation phase. It helps involved parties collect and organize the same information in a structured way, resulting in a clear and consistent document.
            The document can be shared directly as it is, or kept and used later as a reference when needed.
            By going straight to the point and avoiding unnecessary steps, Mobile-TAG helps drivers leave the scene with a complete and reliable record of the incident – regardless of language or location.
